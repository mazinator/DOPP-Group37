# DOPP-Group37

## Questions:
How is the adoption of renewable energy in Europe evolving? 
* Renewable energy adoption trends over years in different countries and sectors [1]
* Get context on how renewable energy integrates into the overall energy mix and consumption patterns [3,4]
How is the adoption of different types of renewable energy evolving? 
* Electricity production capacities for different types of RE in different countries [2]
Are there characteristics of countries that correlate with their level of adoption of renewable energy?

# Datasets
We may use datasets of following collections:
* [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database) (especially the renewable energy section)
* [Worldbank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?q=renewable%20energy&start=0&sort=) (search for individual datasets; good for global data to compare to EU)

Concrete datasets
1. [Eurostat - Share of Energy from Renewable Sources](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_ind_ren/default/table?lang=en): Proportion of energy consumption derived from renewable sources across EU states, segmented by sector (electricity, heating and cooling, transport)
2. [Eurostat - Electricity production capacities for renewables and wastes](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_inf_epcrw__custom_13973000/default/table?lang=en): Statistics on renewable energy production and consumption, including breakdowns by energy type (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and country.
3. [Eurostat - Simplified energy balances](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_bal_s__custom_13973102/default/table?lang=en): Energy balance sheets for EU countries, including energy production, imports, exports, and consumption by fuel type and sector.
4. [Eurostat - Supply and transformation of solid fossil fuels](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_cb_sffm/default/table?lang=en): Energy balance sheets for EU countries (as in dataset 3) but for solid fossils (coal).
