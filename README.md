# Questions
In the following we list the questions we want to answer, including (some) concrete points we will look at and which datasets may be interesting for tackling this question:

## How is the adoption of renewable energy in Europe evolving?
- Renewable energy adoption trends over years in different countries and sectors [1]
- Get context on how renewable energy integrates into the overall energy mix and consumption patterns [3,4]

## How is the adoption of different types of renewable energy evolving?
- Electricity production capacities for different types of RE in different countries [2]

## Are there characteristics of countries that correlate with their level of adoption of renewable energy?
- Find correlations to infleuncing factors (correlation), e.g. GDP, population size, energ prices, eductation level and more  [5,6,7]

# Datasets
We will use datasets of following datahubs:

- **[Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database)** Extensive data on energy, particularly renewable energy within the EU.
- **[Worldbank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?q=renewable%20energy&start=0&sort=)**  Global datasets for comparative analysis with EU data.

## Concrete datasets
[1] **[Eurostat - Share of Energy from Renewable Sources](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_ind_ren/default/table?lang=en)** Proportion of energy consumption derived from renewable sources across EU states, segmented by sector (electricity, heating and cooling, transport)

[2] **[Eurostat - Electricity production capacities for renewables and wastes](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_inf_epcrw__custom_13973000/default/table?lang=en)** Statistics on renewable energy production and consumption, including breakdowns by energy type (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and country.

[3] **[Eurostat - Simplified energy balances](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_bal_s__custom_13973102/default/table?lang=en)** Energy balance sheets for EU countries, including energy production, imports, exports, and consumption by fuel type and sector.

[4] **[Eurostat - Supply and transformation of solid fossil fuels](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_cb_sffm/default/table?lang=en)** Energy balance sheets for EU countries (as in dataset 3) but for solid fossils (coal).

[5] **[Eurostat - Electricity prices for household consumers](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_pc_204/default/table?lang=en)** Bi-Annaual Electricity prices for households across EU countries.

[6] **[Eurostat - GDP at Market Prices](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tec00001/default/table?lang=en)** Annual GDP data for EU countries, reflecting economic activity.

[7] **[Eurostat - Population by educational attainment level](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/edat_lfse_03/default/table?lang=en)** Percentage of the population and age with speicifc education.


# Workload Distribution

Due to (i) the sequential dependencies of such a project, and (ii) the desire for all members to contribute to various aspects of the project, we will **keep track of the number of rounds completed by each person** and aim to minimize the intervals between shifts to ensure timely completion. Most of the work will be conducted during the **lecture-free Christmas period**. 


**Note:** One team member has dropped out post-deadline, reducing our team to three members. We will distribute the workload accordingly.
