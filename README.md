# DOPP-Group37

Year 2024, Group 37. Unfortunately, our 4th member will not finish the course. We have been notified about this after the deadline for group building, therefore we were not able to find a replacement.

# Questions and how to anwer them

## How is the adoption of renewable energy in Europe evolving? 
* Renewable energy adoption trends over years in different countries and sectors [1]
* Get context on how renewable energy integrates into the overall energy mix and consumption patterns [3,4]

## How is the adoption of different types of renewable energy evolving? 
* Electricity production capacities for different types of RE in different countries [2]

## Are there characteristics of countries that correlate with their level of adoption of renewable energy?

# Datasets
We may use datasets of following collections:
* [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/database) (especially the renewable energy section)
* [Worldbank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?q=renewable%20energy&start=0&sort=) (search for individual datasets; good for global data to compare to EU)

Concrete datasets with links
1. [Eurostat - Share of Energy from Renewable Sources](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_ind_ren/default/table?lang=en): Proportion of energy consumption derived from renewable sources across EU states, segmented by sector (electricity, heating and cooling, transport)
2. [Eurostat - Electricity production capacities for renewables and wastes](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_inf_epcrw__custom_13973000/default/table?lang=en): Statistics on renewable energy production and consumption, including breakdowns by energy type (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and country.
3. [Eurostat - Simplified energy balances](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_bal_s__custom_13973102/default/table?lang=en): Energy balance sheets for EU countries, including energy production, imports, exports, and consumption by fuel type and sector.
4. [Eurostat - Supply and transformation of solid fossil fuels](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_cb_sffm/default/table?lang=en): Energy balance sheets for EU countries (as in dataset 3) but for solid fossils (coal).

# Dividing the workload

As we all want to contribute to as much parts as possible and we should submit the results in a single Notebook, an iterative approach will be used: one person works for around 10h on the issue, afterwards the next person and so on.
